# fillit

This is a group project within Academy+Plus (in partnership with Ecole 42 Paris)
My team mate is cborsan@42

The purpose of this project is to make the smallest possible "square" (which can contain holes) with a given list of tetriminos read from a file. A valid figure contains only '.' and '#', 4 characters in a line, four lines per figure; all fiures separated by one newline.
The disposition within the smallest square must be as such that it returns the first possible solution when placing them recursively from the top left.

Run make, an executable called fillit should compile directly. 

Usage:
./fillit file_name
